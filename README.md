# Facial Anomaly Detection
## Executive Summary
Craniofacial anomalies (CFA) are a diverse group of deformities in the growth of the head and facial bones occurs in approximately 1 per 500-700 births worldwide.  Physical deformity has an effect in child’s life while interacting, socializing and making friends. There is a need for assessing the normality level of CFA that could help doctor/care-givers for necessary interventions/surgery. The existing solutions for CFA detection are time consuming and it requires patients to visit hospital and go through complex lab exams. This research proposes to develop a mobile application for real-time craniofacial anomaly assessment through implementing deep learning architecture on mobile device.

## Brief Background
The costs incurred from CFA in terms of morbidity, health care, emotional disturbance, and social and employment exclusion, are considerable for affected individuals, their families and society. Although reliable data on CFA prevalence in Middle East is not available, some researchers estimated prevalence for Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, and Jordan are 1.9, 0.3, 1.5, and 2.4 per 1000 live births respectively. Accurate assessment of CFA at an early stage with the aid of deep learning architecture could provide healthcare professionals a second opinion in decision making for necessary treatments and surgery. 
## Idea Description                                                                                                                  
In recent years, we have witnessed significant advances in the healthcare technologies. An accurate detection of a certain event in real-time that is based on data has seen a surge in interests, owing to the advances in machine learning techniques. In computer vision, AlexNet popularized deep convolutional neural networks by winning the ImageNet Challenge. Deeper and more complicated networks are the trend in order to achieve higher accuracy. However, in real world problems such as image recognition tasks in real-time need to be carried out in a timely fashion on a computationally limited platform like mobile device. There has been rising interest in the recent literature for building small and efficient mobile neural networks. This research proposes to develop a real-time craniofacial anomaly image assessment system using deep learning architecture. Our proposed deep learning model will be implemented in mobile device and can be used to assess CFA in real-time. The end product of this research will be a mobile application that captures image from subject’s face, do real-time image processing in mobile device and finally assess CFA level by providing a score (1-7, normal-severe anomaly). The key objectives of this proposed research are-
### Objective-1: 
Collecting a well representative CFA dataset which comprise of all major CFA categories. This dataset will be sourced from Sidra Medicine for the purpose of retrospective study. To accomplish this objective we will do collaboration with researchers from Plastic and Craniofacial Surgery division at Sidra Medicine.
### Objective-2: 
Developing deep learning architecture to assess CFA image datasets. Performance of different established transfer learning models such as ResNet, VGG, and MobileNets in the context of CFA image recognition will be investigated and best performing models will be selected based on their accuracy.    
### Objective-3: 
Implement deep learning in mobile device for real-time CFA image assessment. The developed deep learning model from objective-2 will be converted to a smaller but efficient version that can be implemented in mobile device. The outcome of this objective will be a mobile application that will allow users/doctors to capture images from CFA subjects and provide a normality score such as 1 (normal) - 7 (severe anomaly) about the camera fed images in real-time.
